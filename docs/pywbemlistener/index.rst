.. _`Pywbemlistener command`:

Pywbemlistener command
======================

The pywbemlistener command can run and manage WBEM listeners.

Each listener is a process that executes the `pywbemlistener run`
command to receive WBEM indications sent from a WBEM server.

A listener process can be started with the `pywbemlistener start`
command and stopped with the `pywbemlistener stop` command.

There is no central registration of the currently running listeners.
Instead, the currently running processes executing the
`pywbemlistener run` command are by definition the currently running
listeners. Because of this, there is no notion of a stopped listener nor
does a listener have an operational status.

.. The maxdepth attribute overrides the maxdepth attribute of the
.. mastertoc if used.
.. The numbered attribute intentionally is not set, because the numbering
.. on sub-TOCs is created automatically when set on the top-level TOC.
