pywbemtools 0.6.0
-----------------

This version is currently in development and is shown as |version|.

This version contains all fixes up to pywbemtools 0.5.0.

Released: not yet

**Incompatible changes:**

**Deprecations:**

**Bug fixes:**

* Fix issue with mixed old and new formats on click.echo statement.
  (See issue #419)

* Fixed missing Python 3.7 in supported environments shown on Pypi.
  (See issue #416)

* Fixed that the 'class find' command showed the --namespace option twice
  (see issue #417)

* Added PyYAML>=5.1 as a prerequisite package for pywbemtools for installation.
  So far, it was pulled in indirectly via pywbem.

* Fixed case sensitive matching of class names in instance modify by
  picking up the fix in pywbem 0.14.6. (See issue #429).

**Enhancements:**

* Add capability to reorder commands in the help for each group.  The commands
  in all groups except for the top group (pywbemcli -h) are ordered in the
  help list by their order in their source file. The display of commands in
  the top level group is alphabetical except that connection, help, and repl
  are reordered to the bottom of the list. (See issue #466)

**Cleanup:**

* Test: Enabled Python warning suppression for PendingDeprecationWarning
  and ResourceWarning (py3 only), and fixed incorrect make variable for that.

* Test: Removed testfixtures from minimum constraints file, as it is not used.

* Test: Increased minimum version of pytest from 3.3.0 to 4.3.1 because
  it fixed an issue that surfaced with pywbem minimum package levels
  on Python 3.7.

* Code: refactor code to use only the .format formatter and remove all use
  of the % formatter.

* Test: Added missing indirectly referenced prerequisite packages to
  minimum-constraints.txt, for a defined package level when testing with
  PACKAGE_LEVEL=minimum.

* Clean up test mock files by merging mock_simple_model_ext.mof into
  mock_simple_model.mof

**Known issues:**

* See `list of open issues`_.
