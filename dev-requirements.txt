# Pip requirements file for development dependencies.
#
# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance. Changing the order has an impact on the overall integration
# process, which may cause wedges in the gate later.

# Runtime dependencies:

# Direct dependencies:

# Unit test:

# Sphinx:
# Note: The ordereddict package is a backport of collections.OrderedDict
#       to Python 2.6 and earlier. OrderedDict is needed by GitPython, which
#       is needed by sphinx-git.

ordereddict ; python_version < '2.7' # MIT
sphinx-git>=10.0.0  # GPL
GitPython>=2.1.3 # BSD

# PyLint:
# Astroid is used by Pylint. Astroid 1.3 and above, and Pylint 1.4
# and above no longer work with Python 2.6, and have been removed
# from Pypi in 2/2016 after being available for some time.
# Therefore, we cannot use Pylint under Python 2.6.
# Also, Pylint does not support Python 3.
# TODO Remove ???astroid>=1.4.9 ; python_version == '2.7'
