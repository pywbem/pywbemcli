        Standard test for pywbemcli commands using pytest

        Parameters:
          desc (:term:`string`):
            Description of the test

          subcmd (:term:`string`):
            pywbemcli subcommand inserted for this test.  This is the first
            level subcommand (ex. class).

          args (:term:`py:iterable` of :term:`string`):
            Arguments to be inserted into the command line after the
            subcommand name. This must be a list of the individual works
            to be appended after the subcmd.

          exp_response ( (dict): Keyword arguments for the expected response.):
            Includes the following keys:

               'stdout' or 'stderr' - Defines which return is expected (the
               expected response). The value is a string or iterable defining
               the data expected in the response. The data definition in
               this dictionary entry must be compatible with the definition
               of expected data for the test selected.
               Only one of these keys may exist.

               'test' - if it exists defines the test used to compare the
               returned data with the expected returned data defined as the
               value of 'stdout'/'stderr'

               The tests define are:

                 'startswith' - Expected Response must be a single string
                 The returned text defined starts with the defined string

                 'lines' -  Expected response may be either a list of strings or
                 single string

                 Compares for exact match between the expected response and the
                 returned data line by line. The number of lines and the data
                 in each line must match.  If the expected response is a single
                 string is is split into lines separated at each new line
                 before the match

                 'patterns' - Expected response must be same as lines test
                 except that each line in the expected response is treated as
                 a regex expression and a regex match is executed for each line.

                 'regex' - Expected response is a single string or list of
                 strings. Each string is considered a regex expression.

                 'in' - Expected response is string or list of strings.
                 Tests the complete response to determine if each entry
                 in expected response is in the response data as a single test.

                 Executes a single regex search of the entire
                 response data to match with each entry in the expected
                 response

               'rc' expected exit_code from pywbemcli.  If None, code 0
               is expected.

               'mock' If this key exists, the value is a list of files that
               represent the mock data. In this case, the connection is
               made with the --mock-server input parameter and the name
               of the mock files as data.

          mock_file (:term:`string` or None):
            If this is a string, this test will be executed using the
            --mock-server pywbemcl option with this file as the name of the
            objects to be compiled. This should be just a file name and
            this method assumes it is in the testsuite directory.

            If None, test is executed without the --mock-server input parameter
            and defines an artificial server name  Used to test subcommands
            and options that do not communicate with a server.  It is faster
            than installing the mock repository
